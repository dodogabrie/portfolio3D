Create the project using the tool vite:
-> npm create vite@latest ./ -- --template react
-> Install tailwind css: an utility-first CSS framework (packed with classes) https://tailwindcss.com/
   The utility-first approach encourages developers to think in terms of utility classes 
   for directly styling elements rather than writing custom CSS selectors
-> Install packages for the project using the flag --legacy-peer-deps (perch√® alcuni packages funzionano solo con il vecchio react)
    - react-three: a react base three.js library
    - maath: pack. for maths and geometry
    - react-tilt: Animations
    - react-vertical-timeline-component: for the User Experience
    - emailjs/browser: for handling email forms
    - fremer-motion: unkown yet
    - react-router-dom: for "routing".
